# MineTranslate
This is the main repository for my Fabric Mod, which translates Java Edition Fabric mods into Bedrock Edition Addons.

## Notes
Needs Fabric, Fabric API and GeyserMC to work properly. Without that, it can't work properly.

## How to translate
You can start translating mods with the /minetranslate command. It has the following syntax:

/minetranslate
- start: starts a conversion task
- progress: Shows the progress how many mods have been translated
- stop: Stops a MineTranslate task immediately.
